# Analysing-rotten-tomato-dataset

Using the Rotten Tomato movie review dataset, I conducted thorough data cleaning to address missing values and ensure consistency. Leveraging Node.js and MySQL, I built a robust relational database with multiple tables to efficiently organize movie details. Additionally, I developed a simple web application providing users with clear insights derived from the dataset, enhancing accuracy and reliability. This tool serves as a valuable resource for exploring movie information and gaining insights into the world of cinema.
